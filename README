Notes for anyone else trying this out:

When you get to the Kernel Configuration step, menuconfig won't work properly.
The workaround is to switch to a different TTY, log in as root (name=password)
and run the following command to enter the chroot:

LFS=/mnt/lfs chapter10.sh

When you are done, switch back to TTY 7.


ALFS (Automated Linux From Scratch) -> alfalfa (reduplication) -> millet (grain often fed to non-humans)
